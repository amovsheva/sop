Broadly speaking, I want to investigate physical and biological systems with interesting observables--population dynamics, pattern formation or emergent phenomena from collective behavior--that are driven by fundamental physical principles. The goal is to identify the underlying rules governing these systems and construct a mathematical theory that can describe the phenomena and generalize to more complicated scenarios. My interest in this flavor of problems was cemented during my work in theoretical evolutionary genetics with Professor Matveyev.

Our goal is to estimate, given a nucleotide in the DNA of any two organisms, how many generations ago did they share the ancestor from whom they inherited that nucleotide. For example, our closest relatives on the evolutionary tree are chimpanzees; how long ago did our most recent common ancestor live? I am building a probabilistic model that can estimate this quantity, called the coalescent time. Current (paleontological) methods put the coalescent time for humans and chimpanzees to be somewhere between 4 to 13 million years ago, which is quite a wide range. We hope that our model will validate and make more precise this estimate as well as be applied to organisms for which we do not have well-preserved records.

Under certain simplyfying assumptions, we have computed probability distributions for the coalescent time of a subset of nucleotides for a given pair of DNAs. We also check the statistical soundness of these distributions by simulating DNA evolution trees. Currently, we are expanding our methods to model an addtional factor: selection.

Formally, we construct an algorithm that inputs two sequences of nucleotides (DNAs), assumed to be of equal length, and outputs coalescent times. However, mutation and recombination add randomness to the inheritance process. To account for this, we treat coalescent time as a random variable and calculate a probability distribution for the coalescent time of each nucleotide in the DNA.

In our model we assume to have sexual reproduction, distinct generations that don’t interbreed, equal population size for all generations, random (uniform) selection of parents for the offspring, mutation, recombination, and no selection (for now). Under these assumptions, we build a directed graph where the nodes represent the individuals and each node has two directed edges connecting to two nodes (the parents) in the previous generation. Each node has a label, a negative number, that indicates what generation it belonged to (the negative means back in time). Also each node contains a numeric representation of the DNA of the individual, along with what parts of the DNA was inherited from which of its two parents, which is determined by recombination. Recombination randomly selects the locations in the DNA which separate parts that were inherited from different parents. These graphs are created stochastically, therefore they have a probability distribution on them.

To find coalescence time for any two individuals in the same generation for a fixed nucleotide we trace the inheritance trajectory the parent of each individual from which they inherited the nucleotide. These two inheritance lines will merge at some point if we look far back in time. The number of generation back from the generation to which the individuals belong to is the coalescent time. Since the graphs are random there is a probability distribution on them, which in theory could be used to find the probability distribution on the coalescent time for the nucleotide. Yet since we don’t know this probability distribution we can’t find the probability distribution of coalescent time this way. Instead, we knew that coalescent time probability distribution of a nucleotide is dependent on the coalescent time value of the adjacent nucleotide in the DNA. We were able to write out the dependence explicitly. By assuming the marginal distribution of coalescent time for the first nucleotide in the DNA (first in the sequence) to be an exponential, we are able to iteratively find the marginal distribution for all nucleotides. The only fall back of this method is the fact that the expressions for the probability distributions are in the integral form. I was able find the solutions for the nucleotides in the beginning of the sequence.

We went ahead and generalized our model to include selection. Before learning how to find the probability distribution for coalescent time of a nucleotide experiencing selection, we decided to first learn how to simulate a graph for such nucleotide. We started by exploring the simplest case when there is selection on only one nucleotide. When we look at one nucleotide only, each child has one effective parent - the one from whom the nucleotide is inherited. Selection means that an offspring has a higher probability of having a parent with the “stronger” nucleotide variant. This probability depends on the frequency of all the nucleotide variants in the parent generation, which makes the creation of the graph difficult since we don’t know these frequencies. Our solution to this problem was to first stochastically find the backward dynamics of nucleotide variant frequencies and then use these dynamics stochastically build the graph. Finding the backward dynamics of nucleotide variant frequencies required reversing the known forward dynamics. The central component of solving this problem was finding the stationary distribution of the transition matrix for forward process. Since the matrix’s size and complexity of its terms depended on the size of the population n my solution to this problem was to send n to infinity. The components of the matrix are a certain sum. In the limit they become integrals that can be approximated with the stationary phase method. I borrowed it from quantum field theory where it is applied to infinite-dimensional integrals. I learned of this approach during the summer before my senior year in my undergrad from Professor Jevicki’s lectures he gave to his research advisees (of whom I was one) and from online QFT lectures from the Perimeter Institute that I watched concurrently.

The kind of research I like to do consists of deriving basic mathematical or physical axioms of the process / system at hand. These axioms would govern the entirety of the system’s behavior. By building a theory using these axioms, it would (hopefully) be able to derive the global phenomena that happen in the system. I really enjoy the approach where I can start with the simplest of cases for such system (with the most restricting and simplifying assumptions), understand them and and solve them completely. By introducing one new parameter at a time I would solve the more generalized system in this approach. This kind of incremental approach really interests me because it makes me understand how each parameter contributes to the complexity of the system and is a systematic and logical way of doing research.

In my research, I’ve enjoyed finding and leveraging both analytical and computational tools from physics, statistics, mathematics and CS. This experience makes Stanford Applied Physics’ interdisciplinary environment very appealing. While researching the department and talking to current graduate students, it stood out that the department really encourages taking courses and collaborating with people in other disciplines. It would be very exciting to bring in new theoretical/computational ideas inspired by the cutting edge research happening in so many different fields. I also want to look at real data and collaborate with experimentalists so that I can make a connection between theory and experiment, something that I have not yet had the opportunity to do. I am very interested in Professor Daniel Fisher’s work in evolutionary population geneticс, especially his paper on the simulation of spread of a mutation in an evenly dispersed population as random individuals of the population moved to random distances in random directions. It showed how changes to probability distribution of distances effected the global spread speed of the mutation. My interests are not restricted to genetics, however, and I am also interested in Professor Andy Spakowitz analytic approach to the mechanics / chemistry of organic molecules.
