I grew up with science and mathematics. My grandparents were spectroscopists, engineers, and doctors, all with graduate degrees. My father is a mathematics professor. Everyone who still works in my family lives by their work. Since I could remember, my father would tell me stories of how the world formed after the Big Bang, what the universe was made up of, what electrons were, how molecules interacted, even if I didnâ€™t understand a shred of what he was talking about. My favorite stories were about Mendeleev and his discovery of the periodic table (we Russians are very proud of him).  We went fossil hunting, explored different chemical reaction using my chem kit, categorized rocks I found outside using different acids. The only career path I considered was to become a scientist (besides my short-lived obsession with ballerinas). 

However, childhood aspirations often have to traverse a rocky path before they are realized. Graduating from one of the best high schools in New York City with five advanced science and math courses under my belt and a decently high GPA, I went on to college with the intentions of becoming a mathematician, just like my father. After my first year, though, I found myself crying in bed over my sliding grades and  growing dissatisfaction with mathematics. I took me another year to realize that my lack of confidence and inability to keep up with my classes, had a deeper cause than I would even think: I never truly believed I would succeed in achieving my goals. If you take a closer look at my family history it makes sense: all the women in my family quit their careers when they started a family and that was usually right after they finished their education, even if they got their PhDs. There was an unspoken expectation in my family, it seemed, that women had to have their kids in their twenties, and put their kids before their careers. I presumed a similar fate for myself. What is the use of fully committing yourself to a field of study if you know deep inside that your destiny is raising kids? This mentality was never a conscious belief. After becoming aware of it I did everything to prove myself to be above it.

I dedicated what little was left of my undergraduate education to developing my scientific thinking and accumulating skills. I switched my degree to physics since I personally found the research physicist did to be more applicable and meaningful. I supplemented physics classes with classes in probability, statistics, operations research, and computer science to build a broad theoretical base and learn different ways of thinking about problems. I tried both computational research - in my Computational Physics class - and theoretical research - my senior thesis under Professor Jevicki. To firm up my research experience in undergrad I decided to take some time off before applying to graduate school. After some probing, I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to work with Professor Matveyev on theoretical evolutionary genetics: a good mix of Bayesian statistics, Markov stochastic processes, and computer simulations. [Conclusion sentence.]

After considering going into condensed matter in physics, I decided to go into material science because of the direct contributions it has to technology and medicine.
