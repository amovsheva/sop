Throughout this, I have really enjoyed incrementally building up our theory. We started by understanding the basic mathematical axioms that govern the simplest case of a system and then gradually introduced one new parameter at a time, thus generalizing our model. It was very rewarding to see, through this process, how each parameter contributes to the complexity of the phenomena we studied. Iâ€™ve also enjoyed finding and leveraging both analytical and computational tools from physics, statistics, mathematics, and computer science. My background in Physics and research experience have made the applied physics program at School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard very appealing. I want to make a transition to Applied Physics where I can use computational and mathematical tools to work on tangible, physics based problems. I also want to look at real data and collaborate with experimentalists so that I can make a connection between theory and experiment, something that I have not yet had the opportunity to do. At SEAS Applied Physics I would really like to work with Professor Michael P. Brenner on self-replication or with Professor Boris Kozinsky on discovering new materials using machine learning.  It would be very exciting to bring into my research new theoretical and computational ideas inspired by the cutting edge research happening all over Harvard.
