I grew up with science and mathematics. My grandparents were engineers and doctors and my father is a mathematics professor. Since I could remember, my father would tell me stories of how the universe formed after the Big Bang and how molecules interacted. We explored chemical reactions using my chemistry kit, and categorized rocks I found using acids. The only career path I considered was a scientist (besides a short obsession with ballerinas).

However, childhood aspirations are often challenged before they are realized. Graduating from one of the best high schools in New York City with five advanced science and math courses under my belt, I went to college with the intentions of becoming a mathematician like my father. After my first year, though, I found myself crying in bed over my sliding grades and growing dissatisfaction. It took me another year to realize that my lack of confidence and inability to keep up with classes, had a deeper cause: I never truly believed I would succeed in achieving my goals. If you take a closer look at my family history, it makes sense: all the women quit their careers when they started a family. This was usually right after they finished their education, even if they got their PhDs. There was an unspoken expectation, that women had to have kids in their twenties and put their kids before their careers. I presumed a similar fate for myself—why fully commit yourself to a field of study if you know deep inside that your destiny is raising kids? This mentality was never a conscious belief. After becoming aware of it I did everything to prove myself to be above it.

I dedicated the remainder of my undergraduate education to developing my scientific thinking. I switched my degree to physics since I personally found the research to be more applicable. I took classes in statistics and computer science to learn new skills and approaches to thinking about problems. I tried both computational research in my Computational Physics class, and high energy theory research for my senior thesis. Before applying to graduate school, to firm up my research experience I seized an opportunity to work with Professor Matveyev on a project in theoretical evolutionary genetics—an interesting problem with a good mix of Bayesian statistics, stochastic processes, and computer simulations. As I worked through these experiences, I learned what problems interest me and that I care about the tangibility and impact of my work; though I am primarily interested in theory, I want to work closely with experiment and data.

After committing to physics, one of the main obstacles I faced was the low confidence I inherited from my past mentality. I also noticed the barriers (for example, fewer women in classes) that make women feel unwelcome to participate in scientific discussions. To overcome this I tried to talk about my research and classes at forums like Friday evening tea hosted by the Physics Department Undergraduate Group. This practice improved my scientific reasoning and ability to clearly explain concepts and ask questions with determination. During my last year at college, I also received a lot of career advice from WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering). In fact, I regret not using the resources provided by WiSE early enough in my education because I was not aware of what WiSE had to offer. At Stanford, I am very encouraged by the active student body and the concrete work done by the Graduate Action Committee and other groups that I learned about from talking to current students. I would like to give back by joining these groups and helping undergraduate and graduate women and other minorities find mentors, improve their academic writing and speaking, and find resources, research, and opportunities. I also want to bring my own perspective about being a woman in science to encourage dialogue about what kind of obstacles women face when they try to pursue a career in science and how to overcome these obstacles. Importantly, I would like to help WiSE with its outreach, to make sure that everyone in the university who needs it is aware of the benefits WiSE has to offer.
