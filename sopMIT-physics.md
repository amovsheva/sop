Throughout this work, I have enjoyed incrementally building up our theory by leveraging both analytical and computational tools from physics, statistics, mathematics, and computer science. We started by understanding the basic mathematical axioms that govern the simplest case of a system and then gradually introduced one new parameter at a time, thus generalizing our model. It was very rewarding to see, through this process, how each parameter contributed to the complexity of the phenomena we studied. However, to construct a careful, bottom-up model, we neglected many details--the different ways DNA can mutate, how DNA can affect reproduction patterns, how population structure and dispersal affects evolutionary genetic dynamics--which complicate the study of evolutionary genetics. For my graduate studies, I would like to delve deeper into this field to understand these factors. This motivated to pursue my interest in biophysics in the physics graduate program at MIT. I would love to work with Professor Jeff Gore on studying  how different species living together in one niche affect one another’s evolution and population dynamic. My interested are not constricted to genetics and population dynamics though. I also find Professor Jeremy England’s study of life-like behavior very fascinating. His bottom-up approach to solving problems really suits my taste in research - he simplifies the problem to the bare minimum, this way extracting the most important factors in the system that contribute to behavior of interest. It would be very exciting to bring into my research new theoretical and computational ideas inspired by the cutting edge research happening all over MIT.
